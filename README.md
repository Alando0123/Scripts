Random scripts that I wrote and use frequently

## FLAC2OPUS - opusenc
FLAC2OPUS uses opusenc to encode all *.flac files in a folder and every subdirectory within it to *.ogg opus files.

NOTE:

For Windows you must place opusenc.exe (from latest opus-tools zip; from https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/opus/win32/) in the C:\Windows\ folder to use the script.


For Linux, you must install opus-tools for your specific distro.
